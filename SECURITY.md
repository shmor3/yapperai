# Internal Security Policy

## Scope

This security policy applies to all internal projects and services within our organization, including but not limited to the "interplanetary-notebook" project and related services.

## Reporting Security Issues

### Internal Reporting Process

1. Do not report security vulnerabilities through public channels or widely accessible internal communication tools.
2. Instead, report any security concerns directly to the Internal Security Team via:
    - Email: <security@interplanetary-notebook.space>
    - Slack channel: #security-reports
3. When reporting, include as much information as possible:
    - Type of issue (e.g., data exposure, authentication bypass, etc.)
    - Affected project or service
    - Steps to reproduce
    - Potential impact

### What to Expect

- The Internal Security Team will acknowledge your report within 1 business day.
- A full assessment will be provided within 5 business days, including next steps and potential mitigation.
- You'll be kept informed of the progress towards resolving the issue.

## Vulnerability Handling Process

1. The Internal Security Team will assess the reported vulnerability.
2. If validated, the team will work with relevant project owners to develop and test a fix.
3. Once a fix is ready, it will be deployed to all affected internal systems and services.
4. A post-mortem will be conducted to prevent similar issues in the future.

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

- Follow the secure coding guidelines outlined in our internal development handbook.
- Ensure all dependencies are up-to-date and from approved sources.
- Use the company-provided tools for static code analysis and vulnerability scanning.
- Never commit sensitive information (like API keys or passwords) to the repository.

### For System Administrators

- Keep all systems and services updated with the latest security patches.
- Follow the principle of least privilege when setting up access controls.
- Regularly audit system logs for suspicious activities.
- Ensure all production systems are protected by our standard security measures (firewalls, intrusion detection, etc.).

## Access Control

- Access to internal projects and services is granted on a need-to-know basis.
- All access must be approved by the relevant project owner and the security team.
- Regular access audits will be conducted to ensure appropriate access levels.

## Data Protection

- All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Personal data handling must comply with our internal data protection policies.
- Regular data protection impact assessments will be conducted for projects handling sensitive information.

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. Immediately notify the Internal Security Team.
2. Follow the Incident Response Plan outlined in our internal documentation.
3. Preserve all evidence for post-incident analysis.

## Security Awareness

- All team members are required to complete annual security awareness training.
- Regular security updates and reminders will be sent via internal communication channels.

## Policy Review

This security policy will be reviewed and updated annually, or more frequently if significant changes occur in our internal infrastructure or processes.
